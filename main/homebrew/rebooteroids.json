        "en": "It took a while until this game was released, as always with a lot of howebrew games. In case of Rebooteroids the development took six years.\n \nThe story: the 'the hyperspace test ship' EWS is malfunctioning. Without navigational data you find yourself in a deadly sea of rotating objects. Weapons still work and you can make small leaps with the hyper drive. But it requires your responsiveness to have a chance to survive."
